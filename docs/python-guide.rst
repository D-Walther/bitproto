Python Guide
============

This document will introduce how to use bitproto with Python language.


Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The python file generated by bitproto file is in Python 3, uses the
`typing hint <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html>`_ and
`dataclasses <https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html>`_.
So make sure you are using `Python3.7+ <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ to use bitproto in Python.

Compile bitproto for Python
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Firstly, run the bitproto compiler to generate code for Python:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   $ bitproto py pen.bitproto

Where the ``pen.bitproto`` is introduced in earlier section :ref:`quickstart-example-bitproto`.

We will find that bitproto generates us a file named ``pen_bp.py``, which contains
the mapped classes, constants and api methods etc.

In the generated ``pen_bp.py``:

* The ``enum Color`` in bitproto is mapped to an ``enum.IntEum`` class, and the enum values are mapped
  to constants as well:

  .. sourcecode:: python

     @unique
     class Color(IntEnum): # 3 bit
        COLOR_UNKNOWN = 0
        COLOR_RED = 1
        COLOR_BLUE = 2
        COLOR_GREEN = 3

     COLOR_UNKNOWN: Color = Color.COLOR_UNKNOWN
     COLOR_RED: Color = Color.COLOR_RED
     COLOR_BLUE: Color = Color.COLOR_BLUE
     COLOR_GREEN: Color = Color.COLOR_GREEN

* The ``Timestamp`` in bitproto is also mapped to a typing hint alias:

  .. sourcecode:: python

     Timestamp = int # 64bit

* The ``message Pen`` in bitproto is mapped to a dataclass decorated class in Python:

  .. sourcecode:: python

     @dataclass
     class Pen(bp.MessageBase):
         BYTES_LENGTH: ClassVar[int] = 9
         color: Color = 0 # 3bit
         produced_at: Timestamp = field(default_factory=bp_default_factory_Timestamp) # 64bit

* The compiler also generates two method on the class ``Pen``, the encoder and the decoder:

  .. sourcecode:: python

     def encode(self) -> bytearray:
         pass

     def decode(self, s: bytearray) -> None:
         pass

Install bitproto Python library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bitproto serialization requires a language-specific library to work, the generated
encoder and decoder depends on the bitproto Python library underlying.

Install the bitproto Python library via `pip <http://pip-installer.org/>`_:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ pip install bitprotolib

The source code of the bitproto Python library is hosted on `Github <https://github.com/hit9/bitproto/tree/master/lib/py>`_.

Run the code
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now, we create a file named ``main.py`` and put the following code in it:

.. sourcecode:: python

   import pen_bp as bp

   # Encode
   p = bp.Pen(color=bp.COLOR_RED, produced_at=1611515729966)
   s = p.encode()

   # Decode
   p1 = bp.Pen()
   p1.decode(s)

   # Print in json format
   print(p1.to_json())


In the code above, we firstly create a ``p`` instance of type ``Pen`` with data initilization,
then call a method ``p.encode()`` to encode ``p`` and return the encoded buffer ``s``, which is
an ``bytearray``.

In the decoding part, we construct another ``p1`` instance of type ``Pen`` with zero initilization,
then call a method ``p1.decode()`` to decode bytes from buffer ``s`` into ``p1``.

The compiler also generates a method ``to_json()`` to return the json string format of the structure.

Let's run it:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   $ python main.py
   {"color": 1, "produced_at": 1611515729966}
